## Frontend Implementation

The frontend of this application is built using standard web technologies. Hereâ€™s how it communicates with the backend:

- **AJAX calls** are made to the `/api/tax-prompt` endpoint to send user questions and receive answers asynchronously.
- The chat interface updates dynamically without requiring a page reload, providing a smooth user experience.

### Example JavaScript Code

Here's a sample snippet of how AJAX is implemented in the frontend:

```javascript
$(document).ready(function() {
    $("#sendButton").click(function() {
        const userQuestion = $("#userInput").val();
        $.ajax({
            url: "/api/tax-prompt",
            method: "POST",
            contentType: "application/json",
            data: JSON.stringify({ question: userQuestion }),
            success: function(response) {
                $("#chatArea").append(`<div>User: ${userQuestion}</div>`);
                $("#chatArea").append(`<div>Bot: ${response.answer}</div>`);
            }
        });
    });
});
```

## Testing

You can test the application using tools like Postman or directly through the frontend interface. Ensure that the server is running to receive requests.
